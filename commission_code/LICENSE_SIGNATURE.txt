DEX Shell License & Signature Notes
----------------------------------

This file contains instructions and the public key fingerprint used to verify
commissioned license signatures for DEX Shell.

Keep the private key secure. The DEX team uses RSA-3072 keys and signs license
payloads with RSA-PSS (SHA-256). Consumers should verify signatures before
accepting license files.

Public key fingerprint (SHA-256 of PEM):
REPLACE_WITH_PUBLIC_KEY_SHA256_HEX

Sample verification steps:
1. Obtain public_key.pem from a trusted source (DO NOT accept it from the same channel as the license if possible).
2. Compute fingerprint:
   openssl pkey -pubin -in public_key.pem -outform DER | sha256sum
3. Verify signature:
   python key_generator.py verify --public public_key.pem --payload license.json --sig license.sig

Do not distribute private_key.pem. If it is compromised, revoke all issued licenses and publish a new public key fingerprint.
