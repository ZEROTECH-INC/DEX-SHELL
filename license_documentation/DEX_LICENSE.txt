```markdown
# Contributing to <PROJECT_NAME>

Thanks for wanting to contribute! This document explains the process for code, docs, and issue work.

## Code of Conduct
Follow `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

## How to contribute
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a topic branch: `git checkout -b feat/short-description`.
3. Run tests and linting locally.
4. Open a Pull Request with a clear description, test notes, and linked issues.

## Style
- Python: follow PEP8, black formatting recommended.
- JavaScript: follow ESLint (if present).
- Commit message style: `type(scope): short description` (e.g., `feat(cli): add 'dex status' command`).

## PR checklist
- [ ] Tests added or updated
- [ ] Linting passes

5) SECURITY.md (vulnerability disclosure)

# Security Policy

Report security issues to: <your-sec-email>

We will respond within 72 hours. Please do not disclose vulnerabilities publicly before they are fixed.

## Supported versions
- `main`: actively maintained

6) ARCHITECTURE.md (technical overview)

# Architecture Overview

Describe architecture layers: core engine, UI, plugin system, CommissionCore, data pipelines, ML components, IPC, and CI.

Include diagrams (PNG/SVG) in `docs/` if possible.

Example sections:
- Core (Python) — command engine, plugin manager, SLIP interpreter
- UI — Qt/QML + OpenGL shaders
- ML — gesture model (ONNX/TensorFlow)
- Security — CommissionCore signature verification
- Deployment — packaging, CI, installers

7) ROADMAP.md (short product roadmap)

# Roadmap

Short-term (0-3 months):
- Stabilize CLI, plugin loader
- Add CommissionCore integration to all repos
- Basic SLIP interpreter demo

Mid-term (3-9 months):
- Qt UI prototype
- Gesture model training pipeline
- Release alpha to testers

Long-term (9-18 months):
- Cross-platform installers
- Local LLM integration
- Commercial licensing and partner integrations

8) RELEASE_PROCESS.md (how you release)


# Release Process

1. Branch `release/x.y.z`
2. Bump version in `pyproject.toml` / `package.json`
3. Prepare CHANGELOG entry
4. Run full test suite and linters
5. Create release tag and push to GitHub
6. Build packages and upload artifacts to release page

9) CHANGELOG.md (keep semantic)

# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

11) LEGAL_README.md (how to use license + CommissionCore)

# Legal & Project Signature

- This repository uses `ZR_LICENSE.txt` as its primary license.
- CommissionCore: the file `CommissionCore/secure_store/key.bin` holds an AES-encrypted project fingerprint.
- To verify identity, run `python CommissionCore/core_signature.py` → choose Verify.
- For legal enforcement or trusted notarization, consider registering your generated key and metadata with a trusted timestamping or notary service (e.g., blockchain anchor, timestamping authority).
